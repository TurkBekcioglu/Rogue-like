Safeguard is a turn based strategy game where a player gathers and utilizes various resources in order to combat the pollution spreading over the map.

  

Roles:

- Designed tile types and behaviors
- Designed and developed character backgrounds and behavior
- Scripted character actions and map behaviors.
- Assisted with many other parts of the game such as turn based logic, pollution spread, and character movement.
 

My main responsibilities focused on implementing the actions available to the player, but I was also involved in most of the other programming roles due to the small size of our team.

NOTE: In order to play the demo simply select the Rogue-Like.exe - Shortcut.
