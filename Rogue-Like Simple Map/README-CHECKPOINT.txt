Map generation is implemented, several interaction are already coded.
Next is further implementations of classes and methods.
Assets ad further polish is to be implemented later on.
Proposal mainly remains the same, we have cycled through several desugn and implementation ideas.
Originally were going to use a physics-based dungeon generator to model room flow, instead 
decided to ranimly place rooms then generate a maze between them.
Now need to continue to refine how rendering works, how monsters and spawned and base inventory interactions.
Need to implement spawning enemies, doors, boss, chests, and stairs algorithmically. 
Still need player control and general movement, as well as field of view.
